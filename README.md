Permissions
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />

FileProvider Setup: To use FileProvider, configure it in your AndroidManifest.xml:
    <provider
        android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider"
        android:authorities="com.example.yourapp.fileprovider"
        android:exported="false"
        android:grantUriPermissions="true">
        <meta-data
            android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
            android:resource="@xml/file_paths" />
    </provider>

And create a res/xml/file_paths.xml to specify the allowed paths:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <paths xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
      <external-path
          name="my_images"
          path="Android/data/com.example.yourapp/files/Pictures" />
  </paths>

UCrop Setup: Ensure that UCrop is properly added to your build.gradle:
  implementation 'com.github.yalantis:ucrop:2.2.6'
